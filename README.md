# GoTorch

ðŸ”¥**GoTorch**ðŸ”¥ is a high-performance, CPU-optimized implementation of PyTorch built using Golang at its core, and wrapped for Python use. Designed for highly-concurrent matrix operations and training deep learning models on CPUs, GoTorch leverages Go's concurrency model to achieve efficient computation.

---

## **Outline**

- **High-Performance CPU Training/Inference**: Optimize for parallel computation of matrix operations using Go's concurrency 
- **Ease of Use**: Provide a Python API that mimics PyTorch for seamless integration with existing ML workflows 
- **Extensibility**: Allow future GPU support and integration with other ML tools

## **Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Foundation**
- [ ] Implement the core `Tensor` data structure 
  - [ ] Basic operations: addition, subtraction, matrix multiplication 
  - [ ] Broadcasting support 
  - [ ] Python wrapping using cgo or PyBind11 

### **Phase 2: Autograd Engine**
- [ ] Autograd engine for tracking and backpropagating gradients 
- [ ] Support gradient computation for basic operations 

### **Phase 3: Neural Network Layers**
- [ ] Implement common layers: Linear, Conv2D, etc 
- [ ] Utility functions for model creation 
- [ ] Loss functions: MSE, Cross-Entropy, etc 

### **Phase 4: Optimization and Training**
- [ ] Optimizers like SGD, Adam, RMSProp 
- [ ] Design a training loop API 
- [ ] Benchmark training speed against PyTorch on CPUs 

### **Phase 5: Extensions and Refinement**
- [ ] Optimize memory usage and concurrency further 
- [ ] Support sparse tensors 
- [ ] Explore GPU integration using CUDA or Vulkan
